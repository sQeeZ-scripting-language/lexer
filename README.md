# sQeeZ Lexer

The **sQeeZ Lexer** is designed to break down the source code of the sQeeZ scripting language into tokens, which are the fundamental building blocks used by the parser and interpreter. This lexer adheres to the core principles of sQeeZ: compactness, readability by convention, and a focus on data structures.
